# Dictionary Sync

## Work in Progress

I wanted to synchronise the *vim* personal dictionary so that it would be the same on all the computers that I use.  I work on a server, a desktop computer and a laptop and would like the dictionary containing the words I've added to be the same for each instance.

Searching suggested that some use *Dropbox* to provide this service, but as I didn't wish to use it, I search for Open Source alternatives.

There were a number of solutions that required the use of a GUI environment to set them up, but as I wanted to use it on a server, where I don't have a GUI installed, these weren't possible.  I found one command line option, which I experimented with, but could get to work.

It occurred to me that *git* could be used for this purpose, but that I would need to provide the automation to make it work, which led to the development of  this application.

I wanted to:
1. Push the dictionary up to the central repository every time the local file changed.
2. Pull the dictionary down to the workstation every time the server version wasn't the same as the local version.

It has worked for me (so far), though it hasn't been tested more widely.  It doesn't have a lot of dependencies, the c code is just standard functionality, without additional libraries and the rest is dependant on *git*.  You need to have *git* installed as it uses the *git* executable, rather than using *git* libraries.

I currently have it running on *Ubuntu server* and two instances of *Kubuntu*.

I often work, both on my local computer and over *ssh* on the server and will be editing files on both and the dictionaries are kept synchronised.

It should work synchronising any set of files that are text based (else git won't be able to merge them) and that can be stored in a single folder structure.

## Configuring the Application (*vim*)

In my *.vimrc* file I have the following settings that set the language for the word lists that I use, that tell *vim* where to find/create the *spellfile* which is the personal dictionary. The last line turns the spelling on by default, rather than leaving it off.

     set spelllang=en_gb
     set spellfile=$HOME/.vim_spell/en.utf-8.add
     set spell

*vim* keeps a text file containing the list of words, but uses that to build a binary version of the dictionary that it can read more efficiently.  The binary file has the extension *.spl*.  I use a *.gitignore* file within the repository, to ensure that only the text version of the dictionary is synchronised, so I have mapped a function key in *vim* that will regenerate the binary version of the dictionary when I press it. I explain the content of the *.gitignore* file later in the instructions.

     :map  <F4> :mkspell! ~/.vim_spell/en.utf-8.add

The above line is also included in my *.vimrc* file.  It means that when the **F4** key is pressed, the command mapped to the key becomes the current command and pressing Enter executes it. This creates a binary dictionary file from the text file, that is up to date.

## Setting up the synchronisation

Because of  *Linux* permissions you will need to use *sudo* or be logged on as *root* to run most of the commands I suggest.

I give examples of commands that you need to execute in a terminal. The examples will include using the *nano* editor which is considered simple to use. Though if you are setting this up to work with *vim* I suggest you use that.

I will set out the steps you need to go through to set up the synchronised folders, some of these steps only need to take place on one machine, the first one you set up. At the end I will detail the steps that you only need to carry on the additional machines.

---

### 1. Making a folder a local Git Repository

You need to have a folder to put the files in you wish to have synchronised, you can use an existing folder or create a new one and call it anything you want.  I called mine *.vim_spell* and will use that in the examples.  You could use a folder that already has a *git* repository, providing it can be used similarly to  way the way this works.

Create or move into the folder you wish to use and go into it with a terminal.  If that folder isn't a *git* repository you will need to use the following commands to create one.  The second command names the branch *main* (there will only be one).

     git init
     git branch -m main

As this repository isn't intended to be of interest to anyone else it doesn't need a *readme.md* file.

---

### 2. Managing the files in the Repository

Because I was wanting to synchronise only very specific files, I added a *.gitignore* file to the git repository.

I included the following content: 

      *
      !en.utf-8.add
      !.gitignore
      en.utf-8.add.spl

The single * excludes everything, the next two lines include the specific files they name and the last line specifically excludes the binary version of the dictionary (yes, I know the * will also cause this to be ignored).

---

### 3. Setup your Application

Next you need to set up your application, in my case the *vim* editor, to store the files you wish to have in the folder to be synchronised.  I have explained how to set up the spell checker in *vim* earlier in this document, so you need to have done that, or any similar configuration before you move on from this point.

---

### 4. Adding to the Repository

You will now have at least one files in the folder, so you can add any files to the repository. If *vim* hasn't actually created a dictionary file yet, the process will add it automatically, once it has been created.

Execute the following commands within the folder:

     git add .
     git commit -m 'Initial commit'

---

### 5. Going on-line with the Repository

You now need to set up an online *git* repository, making it private if you can.  You need set it up so you can use *ssh* to push and pull from it and take a copy of the URL you would use for this.

Connect the local repository to the remote one using the following command with the URL you just copied/noted in place of the word *URL*. This command needs to be executed within the folder you created and will connect the local and the remote repositories.

     git remote add origin URL

Push the content of the folder up to the online repository with the following command.

     git push -u origin main

You will then be able to push subsequent changes you make, if you need to manually using the command.

     git push

---

### 6. Building the Program

To build/compile the program you need to have the *gcc* compiler installed.

     gcc -pthread -o dic_sync dic_sync.c

This will create the executable file called *dic_sync* in the folder were you run the command, which needs to contain the *dic_sync.c* source file.

---

### 7. Giving the Program a home and permissions

You need to put the executable file in the folder */usr/local/bin/* with the command:

      sudo mv dic_sync /usr/local/bin/

You need to give the program the right security permissions to allow it to be executed.

     sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/dic_sync

---

### 8. Configuring the Program

You need to set up a file in */etc* called *git_sync.conf* that tells the application were to find the *git* repository that contains the relevant files.

It needs to contains a line similar to this:

     /home/mike/.vim_spell/

To create or edit this configuration file use this command:

     sudo nano /etc/git_sync.conf 

Add the path to the folder you created, that contains the local *git* repository as a single line, with a trailing slash (**/**) to the file and save and exit. 

---

### 9. How the Program runs

It is possible to run the command within a *Linux* shell/terminal on each of the machines, only when you want to keep the files synchronised, but to do this you would need to remember to get it running and would have a terminal open that wouldn't be usable just showing occasional messages when it did something.

Running it as a service, is the term that is used to describe running it automatically in the background, so you need not be aware it is running.

To run it as a service you need to create a unit file, in a specific folder and include some details that tell the computer where to find the file and give it instructions on running it.

To create the unit file:

     sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/dic_sync.service

Paste the text below into it and save it:

     Description=Dictionary Sync 

     [Service] 
     User=mike 
     Type=simple 
     ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/dic_sync 
     Restart=on-failure 
     RestartSec=10 
     KillMode=process 

     [Install] 
     WantedBy=multi-user.target

---

### 10. Starting it running

Once you have created the unit file you can set it up to run automatically, every time the computer starts.

To do this run the following commands:

     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl start  dic_sync.service
     sudo systemctl status dic_sync.service
     sudo systemctl enable dic_sync.service

It these run without error the program will be run and continue to run whilst the computer it is installed on, is running.

It can be disabled using the command:

     sudo systemctlÂ disable example.service

---

This works for me and is here to be used and modified as required.  It probably isn't the best solution for this problem.  It is more a quick and dirty solution rather than something for wider distribution I'm open to suggestions on how it can be improved.
